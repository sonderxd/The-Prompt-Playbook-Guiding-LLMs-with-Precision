If you’ve ever wanted to understand how to talk to AI effectively, you're not alone. Prompt engineering is quickly becoming a must-have skill in the age of generative AI—and thanks to Google Cloud's Prompt Design in Vertex AI course, learning it has never been more approachable.

I recently completed the course, and I have to say: it’s one of the most thoughtfully designed learning experiences I’ve come across. Whether you’re a developer, data scientist, or just curious about AI, this course meets you where you are and walks you forward—lab by lab.

Here’s a look at each lab, what I learned, and why it all just clicked.

🚀 Lab 1: Intro to Prompt Engineering with Best Practices
Right out of the gate, the course doesn’t overwhelm you with jargon or complex code. Instead, it gently introduces you to prompt engineering fundamentals—how to write prompts that are clear, specific, and purposeful.

You start with things like:

->The difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompting.

->How to guide LLMs using chain-of-thought reasoning.

->Turning open-ended prompts into more targeted classification tasks.

What I appreciated here was how hands-on it felt, even in the early stages. You don’t just read—you try, tweak, and observe the results. It’s like learning a new language, but way more fun.

✅ Benefit: You build a solid foundation with zero stress. The examples and experiments show you how small prompt tweaks can make a huge difference in LLM output.

🧪 Lab 2: Explore Vertex AI Studio with Gemini
This lab felt like stepping into a playground—Vertex AI Studio is the interface that makes testing prompts feel creative and fun. You don’t need to install anything or write code. Just point, click, and create.

Here, you explore Gemini's multimodal capabilities (text + image input), test different prompt strategies, and even learn how adding context and examples improves response quality.

What stood out to me was how Google brought the power of AI to a simple UI that makes you feel in control, even if you’ve never touched machine learning before.

✅ Benefit: You gain confidence fast. The visual interface makes learning intuitive—and watching Gemini analyze an image or summarize with context is genuinely cool.

💻 Lab 3: Code It with the Gen AI SDK in Python
Now that you’ve got a feel for the concepts, Lab 3 dives into code—but don’t worry, it’s super digestible. Using Google’s Gen AI SDK, you learn how to:

->Send prompts via Python

->Manage safety filters

->Stream responses

->Use advanced features like token counting and function calling

If you’re a developer, this lab is where theory meets real-world application. It gives you the tools to start embedding generative AI into your own apps and workflows.

✅ Benefit: It bridges the gap between experimentation and implementation. Suddenly, you’re not just playing with AI—you’re building with it.

🧠 Lab 4: Challenge Accepted! The Capstone Lab
The final lab ties it all together. You're given a real-world use case (marketing product descriptions), and you have to solve it using all the skills you've picked up so far.

What’s great is that while it’s called a “challenge lab,” you’re not thrown into the deep end without a floatie. There’s just enough guidance and tagged learning materials to help you navigate the tasks—like designing prompts, adjusting parameters, and editing exported code from Vertex AI Studio.

This lab made me realize how much I had absorbed without even noticing.

✅ Benefit: It reinforces everything through doing. Plus, there’s something satisfying about seeing your work scored and validated in real-time.

🎉 Final Thoughts: A Big Thank You to Google
What I genuinely loved about this course is how approachable and well-paced it is. You’re never overwhelmed, but you’re always learning. Each lab builds on the last, and by the end, you feel not only knowledgeable but capable.

This wasn’t just a series of tutorials—it was a journey. And Google made sure the path was smooth, empowering, and enjoyable.

🙌 Kudos to Google Cloud for crafting a course that’s not only educational but inspiring. It truly shows how AI is becoming more accessible to all of us.

If you're curious about prompt engineering or want to get hands-on with Gemini and Vertex AI, I highly recommend giving this course a go. Whether you're just starting out or already in the AI space, it’s a brilliant way to upskill.
